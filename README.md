# OneSidebar - The missing navigator of GitHub

OneSidebar is a browser extension for navigating GitHub. It adds a sidebar to let you
navigate GitHub files, issues, pull requests, and notifications quickly on the
same browser window.

No longer having to open too many tabs! Your files, issues, and notifications
are only a single click away!
